Back in 2014, when we implemented [TLS](https://nqsb.io) in OCaml, at some point
I was bored with TLS.  I usually need at least two projects at the same time to
procrastinate the one I should do with the other one - it is always more fun to
do what you're not supposed to do.  I started to implement another security
protocol ([Off-the-record](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/), resulted in
[ocaml-otr](https://hannesm.github.io/ocaml-otr/doc/Otr.html)) on my own,
applying what I learned while co-developing TLS with David.  I was eager to
actually deploy our TLS stack: using it with a web server (see [this
post](https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/nqsbWebsite)) is fun, but only using one half
of the state machine (server side) and usually short-lived connections
(discovers lots of issues with connection establishment) - not the client side
and no long living connection (which may discover other kinds of issues, such as
leaking memory).

To use the stack, I needed to find an application I use on a daily basis (thus
I'm eager to get it up and running if it fails to work).  Mail client or web
client are just a bit too big for a spare time project (maybe not ;).  Another
communication protocol I use daily is jabber, or
[XMPP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xmpp).  Back then I used
[mcabber](https://mcabber.com) inside a terminal, which is a curses based client
written in C.

I started to develop [jackline](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline) (first
commit is 13th November 2014), a terminal based XMPP client in
[OCaml](https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/OCaml).  This is a report of a
work-in-progress (unreleased, but publicly available!) software project.  I'm
not happy with the code base, but neverthelss consider it to be a successful
project: dozens of friends are using it (no exact numbers), I got [contributions
from other people](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/graphs/contributors)
(more than 25 commits from more than 8 individuals), I use it on a daily basis
for lots of personal communication.

## What is XMPP?

The eXtensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (previously known as Jabber)
describes (these days as [RFC 6120](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6120)) a
communication protocol based on XML fragments, which enables near real-time
exchange of structured (and extensible) data between two network entities.

The landscape of instant messaging used to contain ICQ, AOL instant messenger,
and MSN messenger.  In 1999, people defined a completely open protocol standard,
then named Jabber, since 2011 official RFCs.  It is a federated (similar to
eMail) near-real time extensible messaging system (including presence
information) used for instant messaging.  Extensions include end-to-end
encryption, multi-user chat, audio transport, ...  Unicode support is builtin,
everything is UTF8 encoded.

There are various open jabber servers where people can register accounts, as
well as closed ones.  Google Talk used to federate (until 2014) into XMPP,
Facebook chat used to be based on XMPP.  Those big companies wanted something
"more usable" (where they're more in control, reliable message delivery via
caching in the server and mandatory delivery receipts, multiple devices all
getting the same messages), and thus moved away from the open standard.

### XMPP Security

Authentication is done via a TLS channel (where your client should authenticate
the server), and SASL that the server authenticates your client.  I
[investigated in
2008](https://berlin.ccc.de/~hannes/secure-instant-messaging.pdf) (in German)
which clients and servers use which authentication methods (I hope the state of
certificate verification improved in the last decade).

End-to-end encryption is achievable using OpenPGP (rarely used in my group of
friends) via XMPP, or [Off-the-record](https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/), which was
pioneered over XMPP, and is still in wide use - it gave rise to forward secrecy:
if your long-term (stored on disk) asymmetric keys get seized or stolen, they
are not sufficient to decrypt recorded sessions (you can't derive the session
key from the asymmetric keys) -- but the encrypted channel is still
authenticated (once you verified the public key via a different channel or a
shared secret (using the [Socialist millionaires
problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialist_millionaire))).

OTR does not support offline messages (the session keys may already be destroyed
by the time the communication partner reconnects and receives the stored
messages), and thus recently [omemo](https://conversations.im/omemo/) was
developed.  Other messaging protocols (Signal, Threema) are not really open,
support no federation, but have good support for group encryption and offline
messaging.  (There is a [nice overview over secure messaging and
threats.](https://www.cypherpunks.ca/~iang/pubs/secmessaging-oakland15.pdf))

There is (AFAIK) no encrypted group messaging via XMPP; also the XMPP server
contains lots of sensible data: your address book (buddy list), together with
offline messages, nicknames you gave to your buddies, subscription information,
and information every time you connect (research of privacy preserving presence
protocols has been done, but is not widely used AFAIK,
e.g. [DP5](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/techreports/2014/cacr2014-10.pdf)).

### XMPP client landscape

See [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_XMPP_clients) for an
extensive comparison (which does not mention jackline :P).

A more opinionated analysis is that you were free to choose between C - where
all code has to do manual memory management and bounds checking - with ncurses
(or GTK) and OpenSSL (or GnuTLS) using libpurple (or some other barely
maintained library which tries to unify all instant messaging protocols), or
Python - where you barely know upfront what it will do at runtime - with GTK and
some OpenSSL, or even JavaScript - where external scripts can dynamically modify
the prototype of everything at runtime (and thus modify code arbitrarily,
violating invariants) - calling out to C libraries (NSS, maybe libpurple, who
knows?).

Due to complex APIs of transport layer security, certificate verification is
[still not always done correctly](https://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=91) (that's just
one example, you'll find more) - even if, it may not allow custom trust anchors
or certificate fingerprint based verification - which are crucial for a
federated operations without a centralised trust authority.

Large old code basis usually gather dust and getting bitrot - and if you add
patch by patch from random people on the Internet, you've to deal with the most
common bug: insufficient checking of input (or output data, [if you encrypt only
the plain body, but not the marked up
one](https://dev.gajim.org/gajim/gajim-plugins/issues/145)).  In some
programming languages this easily [leads to execution of remote code](
https://pidgin.im/news/security/?id=64), other programming languages steal the
work from programmers by deploying automated memory management (finally machines
take our work away! :)) - also named garbage collection, often used together
with automated bounds checking -- this doesn't mean that you're safe - there are
still logical flaws, and integer overflows (and funny things which happen at
resource starvation), etc.

### Goals and non-goals

My upfront motivation was to write and use an XMPP client tailored to my needs.
I personally don't use many graphical applications (coding in emacs, mail via
thunderbird, firefox, mplayer, mupdf), but stick mostly to terminal
applications.  I additionally don't use any terminal multiplexer (saw too many
active `screen` sessions on remote servers where people left root shells open).

The [goal was from the
beginning](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/commit/9322ceefa9a331fa92a6bf253e8d8f010da2229c)
to write a "minimalistic graphical user interface for a secure (fail hard)
and trustworthy XMPP client".  By *fail hard* I mean exactly that: if it can't
authenticate the server, don't send the password.  If there is no
end-to-end encrypted session, don't send the message.

As a user of (unreleased) software, there is a single property which I like to
preserve: continue to support all data written to persistent storage.  Even
during large refactorings, ensure that data on the user's disk will also be
correctly parsed.  There is nothing worse than having to manually configure an
application after update.  The solution is straightforward: put a version in
every file you write, and keep readers for all versions ever written around.
My favourite marshalling format (human readable, structured) are still
S-expressions - luckily there is a
[sexplib](https://github.com/janestreet/sexplib) in OCaml for handling these.

I also appreciate another property of software: don't ever transmit any data or
open a network connection unless initiated by the user.  Don't be obviously
fingerprintable.  A more mainstream demand is surely that software should not
phone home - that's why I don't know how many people are using jackline, reports
based on friends opinions are hundreds of users, I personally know at least
several dozens.

As written [earlier](https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/OperatingSystem), I often take
a look at the trusted computing base of a computer system.  Jackline's trusted
computing base consists of the client software itself, its OCaml dependencies
(including OTR, TLS, tty library, ...), then the OCaml runtime system, which
uses some parts of libc, and a whole UNIX kernel underneath -- one goal is to
have jackline running as a unikernel (then you connect via SSH or telnet and
TLS).

There are only a few features I need in an XMPP client: single account, strict
validation, delivery receipts, notification callback, being able to deal with
friends logged in multiple times with wrongly set priorities - and end-to-end
encryption.  I don't need inline HTML, avatar images, my currently running
music, leaking timezone information, etc.  I explicitly don't want to import any
private key material from other clients and libraries, because I want to ensure
that the key was generated by a good random number generator (read [David's blog
article](https://mirage.io/blog/mirage-entropy) on randomness and entropy).

The security story is crucial: always do strict certificate validation, fail
hard, make it noticable by the user if they're doing insecure communication.
Only few people are into reading out loud their OTR public key fingerprint, and
SMP is not trivial -- thus jackline records the known public keys together with
a set of resources used, a session count, and blurred timestamps (accuracy: day)
when the publickey was initially used and when it was used the last time.

I'm pragmatic - if there is some server (or client) deployed out there which
violates (my interpretation of) the specification, I'm happy to [implement
workarounds](https://github.com/hannesm/ocaml-otr/issues/10).  Initially I
worked roughly one day a week on jackline.

To not release the software for some years was something I learned from the
[slime](https://common-lisp.net/project/slime/) project ([watch Luke's
presentation from 2013](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZDWJfB9XY4)) - if
there's someone complaining about an issue, fix it within 10 minutes and ask
them to update.  This only works if each user compiles the git version anyways.

## User interface

![other screenshot](https://berlin.ccc.de/~hannes/jackline.png)

Stated goal is *minimalistic*.  No heavy use of colours.  Visibility on
both black and white background (btw, as a Unix process there is no way to find
out your background colour (or is there?)).  The focus is also *security* - and
that's where I used colours from the beginning: red is unencrypted (non
end-to-end, there's always the transport layer encryption) communication, green
is encrypted communication.  Verification status of the public key uses the same
colours: red for not verified, green for verified.  Instead of colouring each
message individually, I use the encryption status of the active contact
(highlighted in the contact list, where messages you type now will be sent to)
to colour the entire frame.  This results in a remarkable visual indication and
(at least I) think twice before presssing `return` in a red terminal.  Messages
were initially white/black, but got a bit fancier over time: incoming messages
are bold, multi user messages mentioning your nick are underlined.

The graphical design is mainly inspired by mcabber, as mentioned earlier.  There
are four components: the contact list in the upper left, chat window upper
right, log window on the bottom (surrounded by two status bars), and a readline
input.  The sizes are configurable (via commands and key shortcuts).  A
different view is having the chat window fullscreen (or only the received
messages) - useful for copy and pasting fragments.  Navigation is done in the
contact list.  There is a single active contact (colours are inverted in the
contact list, and the contact is mentioned in the status bar), whose chat
messages are displayed.

There is not much support for customisation - some people demanded to have a
7bit ASCII version (I output some unicode characters for layout).  Recently I
added support to customise the colours.  I tried to ensure it looks fine on both
black and white background.

## Code

Initially I targeted GTK with OCaml, but that excursion only lasted [two
weeks](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/commit/17b674130f7b1fcf2542eb5e0911a40b81fc724e),
when I switched to a [lambda-term](https://github.com/diml/lambda-term) terminal
interface.

### UI

The lambda-term interface survived for a good year (until [26th Jan
2016](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/commit/47ae690eb720cbb89323d98b0f7af17bfaea26e7)),
when I started to use [notty](https://github.com/pqwy/notty) - developed by
David - using a decent [unicode library](http://erratique.ch/software/uutf).

Notty back then was under heavy development, I spend several hours rebasing
jackline to updates in notty.  What I got out of it is proper unicode support:
the symbol 茶 gets two characters width (see screenshot at top of page), and the layouting keeps track
how many characters are already written on the terminal.

I recommend to look into [notty](https://github.com/pqwy/notty) if you want to
do terminal graphics in OCaml!

### Application logic

Stepping back, an XMPP client reacts to two input sources: the user input
(including terminal resize), and network input (or failure).  The output is a
screen (80x25 characters) image.  Each input event can trigger output events on
the display and the network.

I used to use multiple threads and locking between shared data for these kinds
of applications: there can go something wrong when network and user input
happens at the same time, or what if the output is interrupted by more input
(which happens e.g. during copy and paste).

Initially I used lots of shared data and had hope, but this was clearly not a
good solution.  Nowadays I use mailboxes, and separate tasks which wait for
receiving a message: one task which writes persistent data (session counts,
verified fingerprints) periodically to ask, another which writes on change to
disk, an error handler
([`init_system`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/bin/jackline.ml#L3-L25))
which resets the state upon a connection failure, another task which waits for
user input
([`read_terminal`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_input.ml#L169)),
one waiting for network input ([`Connect`, including reconnecting
timers](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_state.ml#L202)),
one to call out the notification hooks
([`Notify`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_state.ml#L100)),
etc.  The main task is simple: wait for input, process input (producing a new
state), render the state, and recursively call itself
([`loop`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_client.ml#L371)).

Only recently I solved the copy and paste issue by [delaying all redraws by
40ms](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/commit/cab34acab004023911997ec9aee8b00a976af7e4),
and canceling if another redraw is scheduled.

The whole
[`state`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_state.ml#L29-L58)
contains some user interface parameters (`/buddywith`, `/logheight`, ..), as
well as the contact map, which contain users, which have sessions, each
containing chat messages.

The code base is just below 6000 lines of code (way too big ;), and nowadays
supports multi-user chat, sane multi-resource interaction (press `enter` to show
all available resources of a contact and message each individually in case you
need to), configurable colours, tab completions for nicknames and commands,
per-user input history, emacs keybindings.  It even works with the XMPP gateway
provided by slack (some startup doing a centralised groupchat with picture embedding and
animated cats).

### Road ahead

Common feature requests are: [omemo
support](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/issues/153), [IRC
support](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/issues/104), [support for multiple
accounts](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/issues/115) (TBH, these are all
things I'd like to have as well).

But there's some mess to clean up:

1. The [XMPP library](https://github.com/ermine/xmpp) makes heavy use of
functors (to abstract over the concrete IO, etc.), and embeds IO deep inside it.
I do prefer (see e.g. [our TLS paper](https://usenix15.nqsb.io), or [my ARP
post](https://hannes.nqsb.io/Posts/ARP)) these days to have a pure interface for
the protocol implementation, providing explicit input (state, event, data), and
output (state, action, potentially data to send on network, potentially data to
process by the application).  The [sasl
implementation](https://github.com/hannesm/xmpp/blob/eee18bd3dd343550169969c0b45548eafd51cfe1/src/sasl.ml)
is partial and deeply embedded.  The XML parser is as well deeply embedded (and [has
some
issues](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/issues/8#issuecomment-67773044)).
The library needs to be torn apart (something I procrastinate since more than
a year).  Once it is pure, the application can have full control over when to
call IO (and esp use the same protocol implementation as well for registering a
new account - [currently not
supported](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/issues/12)).

2. On the frontend side (the `cli` subfolder), there is too much knowledge of
XMPP.  It should be more general, and be reusable (some bits and pieces are
notty utilities, such as wrapping a string to fit into a text box of specific
width (see
[`split_unicode`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_support.ml#L22)).

3. The command processing engine itself is 1300 lines (including ad-hoc string
parsing)
([`Cli_commands`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_commands.ml)),
best to replaced by a more decent command abstraction.

4. A big record of functions
([`user_data`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/src/xmpp_callbacks.ml#L46))
is passed (during `/connect` in
[`handle_connect`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_commands.ml#L221-L582))
from the UI to the XMPP task to inject messages and errors.

5. The global variable
[`xmpp_session`](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/blob/ec8f8c01d6503bf52be263cd319ef21f2b62ff2e/cli/cli_state.ml#L200)
should be part of the earlier mentioned `cli_state`.

6. Having jackline self-hosted as a MirageOS unikernel.  I've implemented a a
[telnet](https://github.com/hannesm/telnet) server, there is a [notty
branch](https://github.com/pqwy/notty/tree/mirage) be used with the telnet
server.  But there is (right now) no good story for persistent mutable storage.

7. Jackline predates some very elegant libraries, such as
[logs](http://erratique.ch/software/logs) and
[astring](http://erratique.ch/software/astring), even
[result](http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/libref/Pervasives.html#TYPEresult) - since 4.03 part of Pervasives - is not used.
Clearly, other libraries (such as TLS) do not yet use result.

8. After looking in more depths at the logs library, and at user interfaces - I
envision the graphical parts to be (mostly!?) a viewer of logs, and a command
shell (using a control interface, maybe
[9p](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-9p/)): Multiple layers (of a protocol),
slightly related (by [tags](http://erratique.ch/software/logs/doc/Logs.Tag.html) - such as the OTR session), and have the layers be visible to users (see also
[tlstools](https://github.com/mirleft/tlstools)), a slightly different interface
of similarly structured data.  In jackline I'd like to e.g. see all messages of
a single OTR session (see [issue](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/issues/111)), or hide the presence messages in a multi-user chat,
investigate the high-level message, its XML encoded stanza, TLS encrypted
frames, the TCP flow, all down to the ethernet frames send over the wire - also
viewable as sequence diagram and other suitable (terminal) presentations (TCP
window size maybe in a size over time diagram).

9. Once the API between the sources (contacts, hosts) and the UI (what to
display, where and how to trigger notifications, where and how to handle global
changes (such as reconnect)) is clear and implemented, commands need to be
reinvented (some, such as navigation commands and emacs keybindings, are generic
to the user interface, others are specific to XMPP and/or OTR): a new transport
(IRC) or end-to-end crypto protocol (omemo) - should be easy to integrate (with
similar minimal UI features and colours).

### Conclusion

Jackline started as a procrastination project, and still is one.  I only develop
on jackline if I enjoy it.  I'm not scared to try new approaches in jackline,
and either reverting them or rewriting some chunks of code again.  It is a
project where I publish early and push often.  I've met several people (whom I
don't think I know personally) in the multi-user chatroom
`jackline@conference.jabber.ccc.de`, and fixed bugs, discussed features.

When introducing [customisable
colours](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline/commit/40bec5efba81061cc41df891cadd282120e16816),
the proximity to a log viewer became again clear to me - configurable colours
are for severities such as `Success`, `Warning`, `Info`, `Error`, `Presence` -
maybe I really should get started on implementing a log viewer.

I would like to have more community contributions to jackline, but the lack of
documentation (there aren't even a lot of interface files), mixed with a
non-mainstream programming language, and a convoluted code base, makes me want
some some code cleanups first, or maybe starting from scratch.

I'm interested in feedback, either via [twitter](https://twitter.com/h4nnes) or
on the [jackline repository on GitHub](https://github.com/hannesm/jackline).
